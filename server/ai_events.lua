    Stub for AI event hooks. When implementing advanced cheat
    detection you may choose to intercept game events (such as
    weapon fires or entity damage) and feed the data into an AI
    classifier. These functions illustrate where such logic could
    reside. They are not used by the core antiâ€‘cheat.

-- and other context in a database. Here we simply print a debug
